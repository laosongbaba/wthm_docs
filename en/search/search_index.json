Then, it relies on the phone's automatic network detection to jump to the configuration page to complete the setup process. If your phone fails to jump to the configuration page, please follow these detailed steps: Please confirm that your phone has successfully connected to the WTHM device's Wi-Fi network. This is a prerequisite for the configuration process to work correctly. You can check in your phone's Settings -> WLAN configuration page whether the currently connected Wi-Fi network name is WTHM-xxx . If not, please choose one of the following operations: Use the scan function on the WLAN configuration page to scan the QR code on the device's LCD screen to complete the network connection. Manually select and connect to the WTHM-xxx network from the Available Networks list. The password is wangkong . After confirming that the phone is connected to the WTHM-xxx Wi-Fi network, check if there is a prompt such as Authentication required/Sign in below the network name, or check the system notification bar for a prompt like Sign in to WLAN network . Click on the Authentication/Sign in prompt to trigger the system to pop up the configuration page. If the above steps still fail to trigger the configuration page, please manually open the system browser and enter http://wthm.com in the address bar.
